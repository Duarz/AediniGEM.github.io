			<h3> &nbsp;&nbsp; Team 1 x Team 5 collaboration </h3>
			
			<p>
			To elaborate on the effects of mosquito-borne diseases, they are most likely to infect individuals in 
			countries where agriculture is the main source of income and really helps drive the economic growth. 
			When individuals working on the fields are affected with e.g. dengue, not only does it (understandably) 
			cost the government money in order to provide treatment for these people but it also means that they have 
			less time to spend on essential harvests that further factor into their financial and food security. 
			We believe that if Team 1 and Team 5 collaborate, we could negate both of the above-mentioned effects 
			and have a very tangible global impact.
